 * @synopsis
 *
 * M2J is a multi-dialect Modula-2 to Java translator and via-Java compiler.
 * It supports the dialects described in the 3rd and 4th editions of Niklaus
 * Wirth's book "Programming in Modula-2" (PIM) published by Springer Verlag,
 * and an extended mode with select features from the revised language by
 * B.Kowarsch and R.Sutcliffe "Modula-2 Revision 2010" (M2R10).
 *
 * In translator mode, M2J translates Modula-2 source to Java source files.
 * In compiler mode, M2J compiles Modula-2 source via Java source files
 * to Java .class files using the host system's resident Java compiler.
