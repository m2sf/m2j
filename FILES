(2) Source Code

ProtoInfile.java
  interface for the file reader class

Infile.java
  source file reader class,
  manages file buffer, current position, lookahead, line and column counters
  used by the lexer class to read symbols for tokenisation and obtain lexemes

ProtoTerminals.java
  interface for the terminals class

Terminals.java
  terminals class,
  defines enumerated tokens representing terminal symbols, classifies tokens,
  used by the lexer class for symbol tokenisation
  
ProtoLexer.java
  interface for the lexer class

Lexer.java
  lexer class,
  reads source file via file reader class and tokenises the input,
  detects lexical faux-pas and errors,
  reports warnings and errors using the Diagnostics class
  used by the parser class for syntax analysis

ProtoNonTerminals.java
  interface for the nonterminals class

NonTerminals.java
  nonterminals class
  defines enumerated productions representing non-terminal symbols,
  provides FIRST() and FOLLOW() sets for each non-terminal symbol
  used by the parser class for syntax analysis

ProtoParser.java
  interface for the parser class

Parser.java
  parser class
  reads token stream via lexer class and performs syntax analysis
  detects syntactical faux-pas and errors,
  reports warnings and errors using the Diagnostics class
  builds an abstract syntax tree using the AST class

ProtoDiagnostics.java
  interface for the diagnostics class

Diagnostics.java
  diagnostics class
  defines enumerated diagnostic codes
  provides methods to emit formatted warnings and error messages
  used by lexer and parser classes during lexical and syntactical analysis

Result.java
  generic result class
  used by constructors to return paired results,
  the first item is the value to return, the second item a status code
